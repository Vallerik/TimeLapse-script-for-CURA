TimeLapse-script-for-CURA
====
This plugin/script for CURA allows you to easily shoot time-lapse 3D printing.
The script is tested and debugged, as well as the script has many necessary settings thanks to which you can make high-quality shooting of your print without any defects.
Watch the [video](https://youtu.be/i3y948rIpzE) on my YouTube channel about setting up, installing and shooting time lapses.

To install the script, move the Russian or English version of the script along this path: `%APPDATA%\cura\<Cura version>\scripts`
After that, restart CURA and check the script in the "Extensions", "Post-Processing", "Change G-Code" tabs and select "TimeLapse 2".
Enjoy the use.
